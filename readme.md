# Guest List OOP

Let's imagine we're building an IoT project that will track people as the enter and leave a venue. We want to know things like:

- [x] How many people are at the party?
- [x] Who is inside the party?
- [x] Who came to the party but left?
- [ ] Who's on the guest list and who is not?
- [ ] Can a new person enter the party? (i.e. What's the max capacity?)

If you have time, let's add some tracking to see who's the biggest spender!

- What drinks has a certain person bought?
- What drink are they currently drinking?
- Who spent the most amount of money?
